# spcfixes
This Chrome/Firefox extension makes SPC a bit more usable by resizing the text areas properly according to their content. It also enables the resize handle on the text areas so you can resize them manually if necessary.

Works only for the HTMLUI5 version of SPC, not the Silverlight version.

## Installation (Chrome)

1. Clone this repo
2. In Google Chrome go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. At the top click checkbox `Developer mode`
4. Click button `Load unpacked extension`
5. In the file browser choose the `fixspc` folder within the cloned repo and click `Select`
6. Reload SPC
7. Celebrate!

## Installation (Firefox)

1. Clone this repo
2. In Firefox navigate to `about:debugging`.
3. Click on the `Load Temporary Add-on` button.
4. Browse to the repo and select `fixspc/manifest.json`.
5. Reload SPC
6. Celebrate!

However, the extension will be removed once the browser is closed, so you would need to add it each time you start Firefox.
